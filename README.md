# SQL PORTFOLIO
**Hello, welcome to my SQL portfolio!**
Here, I showcase various projects demonstrating my skills in SQL and database management, ranging from data analysis to query optimization and database design. 
Each project highlights different techniques and solutions applied to real-world datasets.



### This portfolio includes SQL projects that demonstrate:
- Writing complex SQL queries (JOINs, subqueries, CTEs)
- Data aggregation and reporting
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Query optimization for performance
- Creating and managing database schemas
- Handling missing data and data normalization

## Highlighted Projects
- TO BE CONTINUED
  



### Tools
- SQL Databases: SQLite Studio, MySQL
- Additional tools: Tableau, JupyterNotebook (Colab)

### Dataset Information
The datasets used in these projects are publicly available from Kaggle, GitHub, or similar sources. In cases where the data is not included, you can find links to download it from the project descriptions.

## Future Plans
I plan to expand this portfolio with projects focusing on data warehousing, advanced query optimization, and using SQL in big data environments like Google BigQuery.
